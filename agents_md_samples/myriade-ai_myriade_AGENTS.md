## Project Overview

Myriade is the first AI-native data platform.
As it's core, it provide an interface to explore and analyze databases with a data analyst agent.
For enterprise customers, it provides interfaces to maintain up-to-date data catalog, reduce data warehouse costs, assist with modeling, etc...

## Agent Workflow

1. Think about the task required. What is the goal? What is the scope? What is the context? It's not clear or ambiguous, ask for clarification.
2. Explore the possible implementations designs. Unless it's explicit/specific or straightforward, explore the possibilities and find the best solution.
3. Make a plan to develop and test your work.
4. Ensure there is the **minimum of changes necessary** (no more, no less)
5. If, during your work, you discover code to improve, tell it in the PR description.

## Architecture

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vue 3, Tailwind CSS, Vue-Shadcn, Vite (in `/view`)
- **Backend**: Python with Flask, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, Socket.IO (in `/service`)
- **AI Library**: [Agentlys library](https://github.com/myriade-ai/agentlys)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (or SQLite -- recommended -- for light/development implementation)

### Core Components

- `/service` - Python backend with Flask API, chat agents, and database integrations
- `/view` - Vue.js frontend with real-time chat interface and SQL editor
- `/view/components/ui` - Vue.js components from Shadcn
- `/service/chat/` - AI agent implementation for database analysis
- `/service/back/` - Core database query processing and data warehouse integration
- `/service/auth/` - Authentication and authorization
- `/ai/` - experimental/ML utilities not required for app runtime.
- `/setup/`, `/scripts/`, `/data/` – deployment, helpers, and sample data.
- `/docs/` – documentation (e.g., telemetry).

### Key Modules

- `data_warehouse.py` - Data warehouse connections and schema introspection
- `analyst_agent.py` - Main AI agent for database analysis
- `tools/` - Database interaction tools and chart generation

## Development Commands

### Backend (service/)

- **Install dependencies**: `uv sync --all-extras --dev`
- **Run development server (migrations included)**: `bash start.sh dev`
- **Run tests**: `uv run pytest`
- **Lint**: `uv run ruff check`
- **Format**: `uv run ruff format`

### Frontend (view/)

- **Install dependencies**: `yarn`
- **Run development server**: `yarn dev`
- **Build**: `yarn build`
- **Type check**: `yarn type-check`
- **Lint**: `yarn lint`
- **Format**: `yarn format`

### Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Python: PEP8, 4 spaces. Enforced by Ruff and ruff-format. Run via pre-commit.
- Vue/TS: ESLint + Prettier (2‑space indent). Use PascalCase for components, camelCase for props/data, `useX` for composables.
- Filenames: Python `snake_case.py`; Vue components `PascalCase.vue`; TS modules `kebab-case.ts` where already used.
- Imports: keep first‑party packages grouped (see Ruff isort config).

## Environment Setup

### Backend Configuration

Create `.env.dev` file in `/service` with:

```
AGENTLYS_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your_key>
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/myriade
```

In `/service` use `source .venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment

### Development Workflow

1. Backend runs on port 5000 (Flask)
2. Frontend runs on port 5173 (Vite dev server)
3. Production runs on port 8080 (Docker)

## Testing Guidelines

- Framework: `pytest` with snapshot testing (syrupy). Snapshots live under `tests/__snapshots__/`.
- Run all tests: `cd service && uv run pytest -q`
- Update snapshots (when intentional): `uv run pytest --snapshot-update`
- Aim for coverage on new logic (`pytest --cov=service`). Place API tests under `service/tests/api/` and unit tests near modules.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Commits: follow Conventional Commits, e.g., `feat(service): add catalog tool` or `fix(view): debounce input`.
- Scope suggestions: `service`, `view`, `chat`, `back`, `auth`.
- Before opening a PR: run tests, `pre-commit run -a`, and `cd view && yarn lint` if frontend changed.
- PRs should include: clear description, linked issues, relevant screenshots (UI), migration notes if schema changes, and test updates.

## Security & Config Tips

- Do not commit secrets. Use `service/.env.dev` for local dev (see `DEVELOPMENT.md`).
- Supported DBs: Postgres (recommended) and SQLite for quick runs.
- For chart rendering, ensure `cd service/chat/tools/echarts-render && yarn install` on first setup.
- Ensure that user/org only have access to the content they are allowed to access.
